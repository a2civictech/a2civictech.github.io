<h2>Ann Arbor Civic Technology Meetup (a2civictech)</h2>
<p>
  The Ann Arbor Civic Technology Meetup (a2civictech) 
  meets at Ann Arbor City Hall 
  during City of Ann Arbor public meetings
  and at other locations throughout Washtenaw County
  at other public meetings.
</p>
<p>
  To RSVP for a future meeting, see our <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">Meetup</a> site.
  The next meeting is not yet planned; the location is to be determined.
  Join the Meetup group to get meeting locations and future dates for events.
  Ann Arbor City Council meetings are generally Mondays at 7:00 p.m., with exceptions for holidays.
</p>
<p>
  The group meets to discuss technology and the city. 
  Attendees include programmers, project managers, municipal and county IT managers,
  civic organizers, local politicians, 
  and the occasional curious soul who finds the group on Meetup and decides to join in.

  We use a <a href="https://github.com/a2civictech/a2civictech/issues">Github issues</a> tracker
  to identify open civic issues and to track projects for the group.
  To participate and contribute, you'll want a free <a href="https://github.com/join">Github account</a>.
