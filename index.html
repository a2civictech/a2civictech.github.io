<h2>Ann Arbor Civic Technology Meetup (a2civictech)</h2>
<p>
  The Ann Arbor Civic Technology Meetup (a2civictech) meets on the 4th Monday of the month
  at a variety of locations
  in the Ann Arbor area.

  the not-for-profit organization <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org">Code For America</a>.

  The group meets to discuss technology and the city. Attendees include 
  programmers, project managers, municipal and county IT managers,
  civic organizers, local politicians, 
  and the occasional curious soul who finds the group on Meetup and decides to join in.
