<h2>Ann Arbor Civic Technology Meetup (a2civictech)</h2>
<p>
  The Ann Arbor Civic Technology Meetup (a2civictech) meets on the 4th Monday of most fall and winter months
  at a variety of locations
  in the Ann Arbor area.
  We are taking a break for summer 2016.
</p>
<p>
  To RSVP for a future meeting, see our <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">Meetup</a> site.
  The next meeting is not yet planned; the location is to be determined.
  Join the Meetup group to get meeting locations and future dates for events.
</p>
<p>
  The group meets to discuss technology and the city. Attendees include 
  programmers, project managers, municipal and county IT managers,
  civic organizers, local politicians, 
  and the occasional curious soul who finds the group on Meetup and decides to join in.
</p>
<p>
  We use a <a href="https://github.com/a2civictech/a2civictech/issues">Github issues</a>
  tracker to identify open civic issues and to track projects for the group.
  To participate and contribute, you'll want a free <a href="https://github.com/join">Github account</a>.
